**Description:** In this lecture, the professor continued to talk about the dynamics of homogeneous expansion; summarized mathematical model and equations, conventions, types of solutions and evolution of a flat universe.

**Instructor:** Alan Guth

**Erratum**: On slide 6 (at 17:25 minutes), the equation "a^(1/2) a da = const dt" should read "a^(1/2) da = const dt"
